"One can use lucky bamboo with the intention to bring in its qualities: strength, expansiveness and quick, steady growth," says Cho. "I like to recommend a pair in one vase to cultivate support for an existing or desired romantic relationship. They're also typically very easy to care for."</p>

                    Watering: Every one to two weeks
                    Sunlight: Medium to bright, indirect light, but can tolerate low light."</p>
